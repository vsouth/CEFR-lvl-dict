FILM REVIEWS
A   The Long Journey

This is the story of two young people who set off on a road trip. Filmed entirely in New Zealand, you’ll see a lot of the wild countryside. Plenty of drama of enjoy plus there’s a real message to this film.


B   Stealing By Numbers

This is a classic adventure story from the past. Sir Harry Rifken is a world-famous diamond thief in the 1930s who escapes from prison and, after a series of dramatic adventures, begins a new life in America. Director Sally Hartman has created a film that will keep you guessing until the final scene.


C   Joss To The Rescue

Everyone loves Joss, the Saint Bernard dog who rescues people lost in the mountains of Switzerland. It’s loosely based on a true story. The scene at the end where two young people are rescued is sure to make you cry.


D   Aim For The Stars

This story is about the very first people to fly to the moon. It looks into the lives of some of the people involved in this important event, particularly Buzz Aldrin, the second man to step onto the moon’s surface. This may be a true story, but there’s enough drama in it to keep most people interested. The last part of the film is quite unexpected.

E   Tree Of Life

A beautiful documentary about the difficulties of life for the inhabitants of the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest. It’s a surprising film, made almost entirely of interviews with local people, recorded as they toured North America to tell people about the damage being done to their environment.


F   Down On The Farm

There are some exciting scenes where Winona Judd learns to race horses on her parents’ farm, but the relationship between Winona and her strict father is the central topic of this unusual film. Although a lot of things happen in this film, it’s so well written that the story is always easy to understand.


G   The Island

This is a romantic film partly filmed on a beautiful Pacific island. What’s special about this film is the quality of the acting. The audience really sees the couple’s happiness when they are together and feels the sadness of the conclusion.


H   Maximum Force

Ronnie Deane is the star of this film, so you know what to expect – a lot of car chases, fighting and jumping out of planes. This one’s about a criminal who decides to become the best private detective of the 21st century. Fans will love it!
